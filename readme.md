# Thought Jotter Chrome Extension

This was built as part of my learning path through scrimba.com's training materials.
The core of the application is therefore remarkably similar to what was demonstrated
in the lessons i.e. the "Lead Tracker" extension. As such, some of the code is 
identical to what was presented in the lesson.

That being the case, this repo was originally just going to be a 1:1 recreation
of the lesson as a record of my learning. However as I progressed through the lesson
I did deviate a bit and adjusted the JS or other implementation details to suit my 
preferences. Hence my decision to rename the extension itself.
